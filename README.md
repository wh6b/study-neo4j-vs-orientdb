Study for CNAM ENG221 - Comparison of Graph Databases Neo4J and OrientDB - In french
This is my raw work and data used for my study about Graph Databases where I compare communities editions of neo4j-2.1.7 and orientdb-2.0.2

I hope my work will be usefull for someone. I will be glad to know that, so please let me know by email ;)
Even if I will not be easy because : 

- it's in french ;
- I do not have time to write a tutorial on how to use src/performances framework ;
- python code is not well commented. 

I apologize in advance, but I do not remember exactly but I had few months to do all this work during my spare time, my first goal was to make a good study for my school, not a suitable collaborative work.
